/**
 * Brief description of what this class/method does.
 * 
 * @param parameter Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 * @since version when this was added
 */
public ReturnType methodName(ParameterType parameter) {
    // Implementation with clear, readable code
    try {
        // Main logic here
        return result;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Proper error handling
        LOGGER.error("Error in methodName: {}", e.getMessage());
        return defaultValue;
    }
}
```

#### Testing Guidelines

##### Required Testing
- **Single Player**: Test all functionality in single-player worlds
- **Multiplayer**: Test on dedicated servers with multiple players
- **Edge Cases**: Test with unusual scenarios (server restart, player disconnect, etc.)
- **Performance**: Ensure changes don't impact server performance

##### Test Scenarios
```
1. Basic Functionality:
   - Right-click Creative Key activates Creative Mode
   - Timer displays correctly on HUD
   - Timer expires and reverts to Survival

2. Command Testing:
   - All commands work with proper permissions
   - Error messages appear for invalid usage
   - Bulk operations work with player selectors

3. Edge Cases:
   - Server restart while timer is active
   - Player disconnect/reconnect with active timer
   - Multiple keys used simultaneously
   - Commands used on offline players
```
